      I love making things with my hands, from pen-and pencil drawings to origami nautilus-shell lamps<alpual-ref><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody refcenter"><img src="img/nautilusLamp.png" height="360px"></img></span></alpual-ref>.  I try to bring creative, artistic solutions to design projects.  I have found that design is as much a language as C++ or Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      I still do much of my web-design layout and wireframing with a pencil and paper, and I even use a wacom tablet and stylus to work in Photoshop and Illustrator because I find the pencil-like stylus to be quick, intuitive and freeing. 
    </p>
      I enjoy the challenge of bringing a creative vision to life, whether it is my own, my clients', or a combination of both.  I specialize in building clean, attractive mobile-ready sites for small businesses and artists.

      <span class="skills">Skills: Responsive design, HTML5, SCSS and CSS3, javaScript, jQuery, angular.js, custom WordPress themes, Java, Unix, Linux. </span></br> 
      I build well coded, smartly designed programs.  When I build a website or app, I care about what goes on behind the scenes.  I want my code to work and I want it to last.  </br>
      I've been coding since I was in middle school.  In tenth grade I was the nerd who built a robot while on vacation in a remote mountain cabin buried in snow.  More recently I taught four years of high school math, physics and robotics.  I've been working as a freelance web developer since 2009. </br>
